# abcd-nda
These Rscripts were adapted from https://github.com/ABCD-STUDY/analysis-nda17 to merge data tables downloaded from the NDA repository for the ABCD project. 
merge_tables_NDA.R will merge the data tables and allow the user to specify tables to exclude
create_DEAPvars.R will create DEAP-specific variables

This script works with the v2.0 release.
